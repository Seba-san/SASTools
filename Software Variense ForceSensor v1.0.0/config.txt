# The values of the following format are included in the general register:
# variable_name=[variable_direction, size_in_bytes, Access(0 read/write; 1 read;2 write), Initial value (deg)]
#If the field is marked as "read" (input) it can be read in a manual (readField(.)) al or acutomatic (bulkRead(.))way but not written.
#If the field is marked as "write" (output) it can be read and written manually(writeField(.)) but not read automatically with bulkRead(.).
#If the field is marked "read/write" it will be read and written manually and automatically.
#This is the default format of the IParser class,
#although it can be modified using the "delimiters" property to adapt it to the needs of each program.

#Inside config file, comments start with '#', blank spaces are ignored and the following characters are reserved: '=', '[', ']', ','
