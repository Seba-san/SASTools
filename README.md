# SASTools
Shared Academy Software (SAS) Shared Academy Software (SAS) is a framework for the development, experimentation and prototyping of robotic systems and automatic control in general. SAS uses the object-oriented programming concept (OOP) applied to control systems development. SAS project started at the University of San Juan (UNSJ) in 2015. It originally emerged under the need to interconnect independent computer programs with a low communication latency tool. Later SAS evolved into a framework that allows to develop, test and adjust a control system in a simple way using a graphical tool such as MATLAB Simulink. SAS is composed of multiple elements. On the one hand, there are the executable modules which are normally associated with a hardware device, be it sensor, actuator, robot or control plant. Each executable module is associated with a graphic block in “SASTools” Simulink library. On the other hand, SAS includes a software development kit composed of libraries and templates for the development of custom
