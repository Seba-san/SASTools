# SASTools
Shared Academy Software (SAS) is a framework for the development, experimentation and prototyping of robotic systems and automatic control in general. SAS uses the object-oriented programming concept (OOP) applied to control systems development.  SAS is composed of multiple elements. On the one hand, there are the executable modules which are normally associated with a hardware device, be it sensor, actuator, robot or control plant. Each executable module is associated with a graphic block in “SASTools” Matlab-Simulink library. On the other hand, SAS includes a software development kit composed of libraries and templates for the development of custom
